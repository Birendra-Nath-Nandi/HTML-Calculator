    "Q1. What is an Exception in Python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program, disrupting the normal flow of the code. When an exceptional situation arises, Python raises an exception, indicating that something unexpected or erroneous has happened. Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as dividing by zero, accessing a non-existent dictionary key, or trying to open a file that doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Syntax Errors: Syntax errors occur when the code violates the rules of the Python language. These errors are raised during the parsing phase of the program before the code is executed. Syntax errors prevent the code from running at all. They are usually caused by typos, missing colons, incorrect indentation, or improper use of Python syntax elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a Syntax Error:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!)  # Missing closing quotation mark\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exceptions: Exceptions occur during the execution phase of the program when something goes wrong, such as attempting an invalid operation or accessing non-existing elements. Unlike syntax errors, exceptions do not prevent the code from running immediately. Instead, they raise a runtime error when the problematic code is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of an Exception:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 0\n",
    "result = x / y  # This will raise a 'ZeroDivisionError' exception at runtime\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is not handled (i.e., not caught and dealt with using exception handling mechanisms), it leads to a program termination with an error message called a traceback. The traceback provides information about the type of exception, the line number where the exception occurred, and the sequence of function calls that led to the exception. This traceback helps developers identify the cause of the exception and debug their code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example without Exception Handling:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 0\n",
    "result = divide_numbers(x, y)  # This will raise a 'ZeroDivisionError' exception\n",
    "print(result)  # This line won't be executed due to the unhandled exception\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 5, in <module>\n",
    "    result = divide_numbers(x, y)\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 2, in divide_numbers\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Which Python statements are used to catch and handle exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`, and `raise` statements are used for exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `try`: The `try` block is used to enclose the code that might raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `except`: The `except` block is used to catch specific exceptions that occur within the `try` block and handle them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `else`: The `else` block is optional and will execute only if there are no exceptions raised in the `try` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `finally`: The `finally` block is optional and will always execute, whether an exception occurred or not. It is commonly used for cleanup tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `raise`: The `raise` statement allows you to raise a custom exception or re-raise an existing exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Exception Handling:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",

    "Q5. What are Custom Exceptions in Python? Why do we need Custom Exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom exceptions in Python are user-defined exceptions that allow developers to create their own specific exception types based on their application's requirements. By creating custom exceptions, you can add more context and clarity to the raised exceptions, making it easier to handle them effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons for using Custom Exceptions:\n",
    "1. **Clarity and Readability**: Custom exceptions can have meaningful names that describe the specific error condition, improving code readability and making it easier to understand the cause of an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Better Exception Handling**: Custom exceptions allow you to handle specific error scenarios differently, providing more fine-grained control over exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modularity**: By creating custom exceptions, you can encapsulate error logic and promote modularity in your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Custom Exception:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class InsufficientFundsError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, balance, amount):\n",
    "        self.balance = balance\n",
    "        self.amount = amount\n",
    "        super().__init__(f\"Insufficient funds. Available balance: {balance}, Required: {amount}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def withdraw_balance(balance, amount):\n",
    "    if amount > balance:\n",
    "        raise InsufficientFundsError(balance, amount)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Withdrawal successful. Remaining balance:\", balance - amount)\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    account_balance =\n",
    "\n",
    " 1000\n",
    "    withdrawal_amount = 1500\n",
    "    withdraw_balance(account_balance, withdrawal_amount)\n",
    "except InsufficientFundsError as ife:\n",
    "    print(ife)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Insufficient funds. Available balance: 1000, Required: 1500\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we defined a custom exception `InsufficientFundsError`, which includes information about the available balance and the required withdrawal amount. When we attempt to withdraw an amount greater than the available balance, the `InsufficientFundsError` exception is raised with the appropriate error message. This custom exception helps provide more context to the error and allows us to handle this specific case separately in the `except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Create a custom exception class. Use this class to handle an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a custom exception class called `InvalidInputError` to handle invalid input in a simple function that accepts positive integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class InvalidInputError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "        super().__init__(message)\n",
    "\n",
    "def process_positive_integer(num):\n",
    "    if not isinstance(num, int) or num <= 0:\n",
    "        raise InvalidInputError(\"Invalid input. Please provide a positive integer.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Process the positive integer here (for this example, we'll just print it)\n",
    "    print(\"Processed number:\", num)\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    user_input = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer: \"))\n",
    "    process_positive_integer(user_input)\n",
    "except InvalidInputError as iie:\n",
    "    print(iie)\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input. Please provide a valid integer.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter a positive integer: 10\n",
    "Processed number: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter a positive integer: -5\n",
    "Invalid input. Please provide a positive integer.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter a positive integer: abc\n",
    "Invalid input. Please provide a valid integer.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the custom exception `InvalidInputError` is raised when the user provides a non-positive integer or an invalid input. The custom exception allows us to handle invalid input cases specifically, providing a clear error message to the user."
